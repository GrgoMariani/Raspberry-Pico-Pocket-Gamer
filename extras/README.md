## Gerber file

You can find the gerber file under `PocketGamer_Gerber.zip`.

## Run on your Linux PC

I've also included an "emulator" built with olc's PixelGameEngine in case you want to try the project without connecting the board. Try it by `cd`-ing into this folder and running `make run`.

Use `QWASD` and your mouse to simulate the touchscreen.
